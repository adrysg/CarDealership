# Car Dealership Application

In this project, I built a mini console-based dealership application. Users will be able to search through inventory based off filtered searches as shown in the screenshot below.

Users are able to add or remove inventory and the changes will automatically be saved onto a .csv file. You can see what the file contains by selecting option 7 and all vehicles will be shown as seen on the screenshot below.

if by any chance the user misses any information, the application will automatically notify user of error and the user won't be able to proceed. This action is shown on the screenshot below.

the overall goal of this application is to be able to show inventory for different dealerships although right now I am only working with one.

I specifically found this piece of code interesting because I reused it many times and just modified it to show whatever I needed it to show.
